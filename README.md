# Silent Failure on Malformed POST Request Body in Express.js
This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in Express.js applications: silent failure when handling malformed or missing POST request bodies.

## The Problem
The provided `bug.js` file showcases an Express.js server that accepts POST requests to `/users`.  It lacks proper error handling for cases where the request body is missing or contains invalid data.  This results in a silent failureâ€”no error is logged, and no error response is sent to the client.

## The Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file corrects this issue by adding comprehensive error handling.  It checks if `req.body` is empty or if necessary fields are missing.  If errors are found, it responds with an appropriate HTTP status code (e.g., 400 Bad Request) and a descriptive error message.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory.
3. Run `node bug.js`.
4. Send a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/users` with a malformed or missing body (e.g., using curl or Postman).
5. Observe that the server doesn't report an error.
6. Repeat steps 3-5 using `node bugSolution.js` to see the improved error handling.
